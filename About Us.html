              The maiden aunt of Parisian grand hotels has been transformed into the exciting young niece. Of all the palace hotels in Paris, one always used to strike me as being quieter and more reserved than the rest. No longer. The staid old Royal Monceau has become the flamboyant Raffles Royal Monceau. For the designer Philippe Starck has waved his magic wand, and the most traditional hostelry in Paris has become an Aladdin’s Cave of modern art and design. I have not yet had the opportunity to stay at the hotel, but I have eaten dinner at its French restaurant – La Cuisine.

              Since 1994, Restaurant La Cuisine has been offering authentic and creative fresh market cuisine. We offer a house made quality cuisine inspired by seasons and regional products.
